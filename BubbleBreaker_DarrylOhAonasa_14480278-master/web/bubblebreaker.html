<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Riyadh (AFP) - A Saudi woman has lost a judicial battle to marry the man of her choice as a court deemed him "religiously" unfit because he plays a musical instrument, a Saudi newspaper reported Tuesday. The ultra-conservative kingdom requires women to seek permission from male "guardians" -- their fathers, husbands or other male relatives -- to travel, get married and other tasks. Two years ago the suitor, a teacher, asked for the hand of the woman, a 38-year-old bank manager from the ultra-conservative region of Qassim, north of the capital Riyadh, Okaz newspaper said. "Because the suitor plays a musical instrument he is unsuitable for the woman from a religious point of view," the court said, according to Okaz. Saudi Arabia, a major US ally, has introduced a string of reforms over the past year aimed at improving the kingdom's image, including ending a longstanding ban on women driving.</p>

<p id="X_comment">"Both interesting and backwards AF. My dad, born to a wealthy line of land barons/feudal lords in Iran was told as a kid that he wasn't allowed to play musical instruments because that was for the commoners. As soon as he moved to the US in '77, he picked up the traditional Persian drum. Plays it at pretty much every party and when we go camping. FWIW, our family lost pretty much all of our land and holdings during the Islamic Revolution, way before I was born."</p>

<p id="Y_comment">"This stigma against musical instruments is interesting because I had always thought the reverse--that musical instruments were historically status symbols of luxury and culture and therefore a sign of good breeding."</p>

<p id="Z_filler">User Direwolf202 was of the same opinion, adding:</p>
<p id="Z_comment">"A close friend of mine was told he wasn't to learn any musical instruments when he grew up, in Iran. He went to college in Europe and then started learning music. Now if I ever need anyone to start playing pretty much any Ethnic instrument from that part of the world, he is the first person I'd go to."</p>
